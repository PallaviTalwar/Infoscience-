**Questions to answer after every class**
1. What did we do?
1. What did you learn?
1. What questions do I have?

In today's class 30/01/2020, We made a jelly sandwhich using algorithms. What we learnt was how to write an algorithm. We also learnt 
how complex algorithms are and that computers can only understand these detailed instructions. I do not have any questions for this 
lesson.
