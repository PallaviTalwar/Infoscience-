What did we do?
What did I learn 
What questions do I have

Today we learnt how to make a Circuit of LED lights to act like a traffic light in tikercad. 
I learnt the code to make the circuit and make the LED lights all work one by one 
I have no questions to do 
The circuit can be seen in the file trafficlight.md
