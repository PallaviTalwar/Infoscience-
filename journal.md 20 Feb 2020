1. What questions do I have?

Today we learnt how to make an checker board and an optical illusion 
I learnt how to make lines and a checkerboard
I have no questions for this class 

Checkerboard optical Illusion :

offset = 50
def mouseClicked():
    global offset
    offset = offset + 1 
    
def setup():
    size (500,500)
    background(255)
    
    
def draw():
    stroke(0) # lines are black
    y = 50
    for inc in range(9):
       line(0, y, 500, y)
       y = y + 50
       
    fill(0)
    stroke(255)
    y = 0
    for rows in range(5):
        x = 0
        for rep in range(5):
            square(x, y, 50)
            x = x + 100
        y = y + 100
        
    y = 50 # start of the even rows 
    global offset 
    for rows in range(5): 
        x = 0 + offset 
        for rep in range(5):
            square(x, y, 50)
            x = x + 100
        y = y + 100
