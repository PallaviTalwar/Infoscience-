WHat are some ways in which computer science can help fight against COvid-19?
- Computer Science can help us keep track on how often people are diagnosed with the illness and where, by doing this could 
easily start quarantining that area and resricting it to the public. It can also help us understand the amount of time there is 
to find the cure - by knowing the rate at which it spreads and how fast symptoms show. 

It can be helpful to use personal computers and in some occassions there is no alternative however, it may be risky as a virus 
could enter your computer and make it so that you cannot even work on it, or using online resources may open up fake news which in
rare cases amy risk a person's life.

Some behaviours to include are 
1. Worry and in some cases panic - Although the public are told not to worry as the situation is being handled, some find the 
isolation as a tough task and require activities outdoor and others may be paranoid of getting the deadly disease. 
2. Sadness, depression - In some cases people are left with absolutely nothing to do and being locked indoors does not help. 
Although they can search the internet for hours they require action and hence this can often lead to depression.
3. Anger - Being cooped up with family for weeks on end makes sure that you see the bad side of them and hence can sometimes 
lead to anger and frustration not intentionally aimed at them but is actually just from being inside for so long.
